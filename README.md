Data Acquisition:

Sources: The data is collected from databases that provide historical weather data.

Methods: Data is acquired using python libraries to extract information from the database
Reading Files:
CSV Files: Using libraries like pandas (pd.read_csv) to read comma-separated values (CSV) files.
Excel Files: pandas (pd.read_excel) for reading Excel files.

Data Wrangling:

Cleaning: Raw weather data is cleaned by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Transformation: Data is transformed by converting datatype, timestamps, scaling temperature units. .
Integration: Additional data sources such as seasonal data or temprature casual statistics may be integrated to enrich the weather dataset.

Analysis:

The cleaned and transformed weather data is ready for analysis, which may include visualizations, trend analysis, or machine learning models to predict weather patterns or impacts on various sectors like agriculture, tourism, or energy.


Conclusion:

Effective data acquisition and wrangling are crucial for working with weather-related datasets, enabling better analysis and decision-making in weather-dependent industries and research fields.
